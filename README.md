# Data engineer recruiting task

## Task Description: 

As a data engineer intern, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining data pipelines to support our data-driven initiatives. Your task is to create a Python script that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it, and loads it into a database table. Additionally, you are required to utilize Git for version control and collaborate on the development process.


## Requirements:
	
Proficiency in Python programming.
	
Understanding of data engineering concepts and data manipulation techniques.
	
Familiarity with Git version control.
	
Strong attention to detail and ability to write clean, well-documented code.


## Instructions:

Fork the provided GitHub repository [repository URL] to create your own copy.
	
Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.
	
In the repository, you will find a sample CSV file named "data.csv". Write a Python script named "data_pipeline.py" that performs the following tasks: 
- a. Read the data from the CSV file.
- b. Perform any necessary data transformations or cleaning.
- c. Establish a connection to a sqlite database (or any other database of your choice). 
- d. Create a new table in the database to store the transformed data. 
- e. Insert the transformed data into the newly created table.
	
Commit your code changes to your local Git repository.
	
Push your code to the remote repository on your forked GitHub repository.
	
Create a new branch named "submission" and push your changes to that branch.
	
Open a pull request from the "submission" branch to the main branch of the original repository.


## Submission Guidelines:

Include a README file that provides instructions on how to run your Python script and any additional information you would like to share.
	
Make sure your code is well-documented and follows Python best practices.
	
Ensure your code runs without any errors and produces the expected results.


## Evaluation Criteria:

**Correctness**: The code should accurately extract, transform, and load the data into the database table.
	
**Code quality**: The code should be well-structured, readable, and follow Python coding standards.
		
**Documentation**: The README file should provide clear instructions on running the script and any additional information.



Note: Feel free to ask any questions if you need further clarification on the task.
